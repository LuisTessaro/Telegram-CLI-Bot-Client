# Bot client

This is not an actual telegram client.
I'm just using the bot api to communicate with other clients. 

By doing this you will have all the disadvantages of being a bot (no communication with other bots, poor 1 on 1 chats, kinda bad security, among many others).

If you would like to make an actual client use [TDlib](https://telegram.org/blog/tdlib)
